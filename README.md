## Description

This project was a practice application for what i have learnt so far in React & Scss while learning new technologies along the way
such as integrating my web Front-end with Baas (Backend-as-a-service) and i have chosen Firebase to learn in this project.

## Features

1- Responsive to all screen sizes.
